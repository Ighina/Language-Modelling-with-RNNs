"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too

And I ain't gonna take it no more

Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride

"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would

In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this

You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving

But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle

"I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
""There is something"", you said, ""that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way""  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl

I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...

"Puedes escuchar Fernando?  
Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras

"I'm down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

"Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind

And it all comes back to me tonight

And my twilight images go by

"Half past twelve  
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

When the air gets cold then I think of us  
Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days

And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
But then I happened to meet  
A begging man in the street  
As I turned down his praying  
I heard someone saying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother

She has a personal style  
Some people love it others tend to go wild

Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady

Pushing through unknown jungles every day

Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace

He's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
Each time when he speaks his mind  
She pats his head and says that's all very fine  
Exert that will of your own  
When you're alone  
Now we better hurry

And never scored romance  
If we'd stayed to play for fortune  
We'd have broke the banks of gold  
We'd have taken old Las Vegas  
For every cent that she could hold  
Love like ours was made in heaven  
It was blessed by Lord above  
We will spend our lives together  
Forever hand in glove

Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The parks and the squares that you see  
All the sounds that you hear  
And the air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
I am the city  
You let me be  
I am the city  
  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
  
Coming through a cloud  
You're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats

"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs  
No poet has ever painted  
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me  
Yes, I let the music speak  
I let the music speak

'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
My head is hanging low  
And it ain't too familiar  
With the feelings that I show  
I know you say you love me  
But I'm looking through your lies  
It doesn't really bother you  
If this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I never thought I could cry for you  
But honey, I will miss you  
'Til the day I die

Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away

"Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  
Ain't heard it a lot since then love  
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry  
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving love is a reason for living  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen  
I've given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that, just look at that cat  
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow

"I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary  
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard  
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing  
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)

Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
How I remember the first time we went to movie  
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown  
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me  
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

You know that I'm not that strong

"Did you see that man in the limousine  
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen  
But she doesn't care, and she never will  
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn  
Just as long as he pays the bill  
  
Did you see that man with a fat cigar  
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar  
He can choose the wine from a vintage year  
He will drink champagne in his limousine  
Where the rest of the street can peer  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)  
  
But you see that man made a big mistake  
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake  
And the money too, all that he can spend  
He can buy the most, nearly anything  
But he can't buy the lot, his friend

Though I would have liked to begin  
So much that I want to say, but I feel unable  
You leave and you slam the door  
Like you've done many times before  
And I cry and I feel so helpless  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Outside I can see the sun trough the open window  
Inside everything feel so cold  
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go  
Somethimes when I just can't cope  
I cling to a desperate hope  
And I cry and I feel like dying  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up  
The sound of a key in the door  
You smile and I realize that we need a shake up  
Our love is a precious thing  
Worth the pain and the suffering  
And it's never too late for changin'  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again

"They passed me by, all of those great romances  
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances  
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy  
And so I dealt you the blow  
One of us had to go  
Now it's different, I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
  
I saw myself as a concealed attraction  
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving  
That's how I started the show  
One of us had to go  
Now I've changed and I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all

"The summer air was soft and warm  
The feeling right, the Paris night  
Did it's best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now you're working in a bank  
The family man, the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away...

The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance

"And when I see the sign that points one way  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears I forced to cry  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
Still find a way to haunt me  
Though they're so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame

"Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I can't take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know what's waiting there for me  
Tonight I'm loose and fancy free  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
It's elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We don't miss them when they're gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothing's worth remembering  
  
It's a dream it's out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city

All I want is to sing it out loud

She says I began to sing long before I could talk

Like a melody can?  
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

"I must have left my house at eight, because I always do  
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due  
I must have read the morning paper going into town  
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue  
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came

Suddenly

He called the number and a voice said: ""Alice Whiting""  
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting  
He was amazed at his luck  
The purest streak of gold he'd struck  
He said: ""I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling  
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling  
Why don't we meet for a chat  
The three of us in my flat""  
I can't forget what I read

Thinking nothing can stop him now

This is getting crazy, I should tell him so  
Really let my anger show  
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite ""no""  
(I'm kind of certain that's the truth)  
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well  
Something like a magic spell  
I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where I'd be if I fell

Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may

Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while

Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?

When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun

In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
We're still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done

How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
Clear-headed and open-eyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done

Man at the door says if I want to stay alive a bit longer  
There's a few things I need you to know  
Three  
  
Coming from a long line of  
Traveling sales people on my mother's side  
I wasn't gonna buy just anyone's cockatoo  
So why would I invite a complete stranger into my home  
Would you  
  
These days are better than that  
These days are better than that  
  
Every day I die again, and again I'm reborn  
Every day I have to find the courage  
To walk out into the street  
With arms out  
Got a love you can't defeat  
Neither down nor out  
There's nothing you have that I need  
I can breathe  
Breathe now  
  
16th of June, Chinese stocks are going up  
And I'm coming down with some new Asian virus  
Ju Ju man, Ju Ju man  
Doc says you're fine, or dying  
Please  
Nine-oh-nine, St. John Divine on the line, my pulse is fine  
But I'm running down the road like loose electricity  
While the band in my head plays a striptease  
  
The roar that lies on the other side of silence  
The forest fire that is fear so deny it  
  
Walk out into the street  
Sing your heart out  
The people we meet  
Will not be drowned out  
There's nothing you have that I need  
I can breathe  
Breathe now  
Yeah, yeah  
  
We are people borne of sound  
The songs are in our eyes  
Gonna wear them like a crown  
  
Walk out, into the sunburst street  
Sing your heart out, sing my heart out  
I've found grace inside a sound  
I found grace, it's all that I found  
And I can breathe  
Breathe now

See it driving nails  
Into the souls on the tree of pain  
From the firefly, a red orange glow  
See the face of fear  
Running scared in the valley below  
  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue

In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum  
Jacob wrestled the angel  
And the angel was overcome  
You plant a demon seed  
You raise a flower of fire  
See them burning crosses  
See the flames higher and higher

His face red like a rose in a thorn bush  
Like all the colors of a royal flush  
And he's peeling off those dollar bills  
Slapping them down  
One hundred, two hundred  
And I can see those fighter planes  
And I can see those fighter planes  
  
Across the mud huts where the children sleep  
Through the alleys of a quiet city street  
You take the staircase to the first floor  
Turn the key and slowly unlock the door  
As a man breathes into a saxophone  
And through the walls you hear the city groan  
Outside is America  
Outside is America, America  
  
Across the field you see the sky ripped open  
See the rain through a gaping wound  
Pounding on the women and children  
Who run  
Into the arms  
Of America

No one here to blame  
No one to point the finger  
It's just you and me and the rain

It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Would everything be alright  
God has got his phone off the hook, babe  
Would he even pick up if he could  
It's been a while since we saw that child  
Hanging 'round this neighborhood  
You see his mother dealing in a doorway  
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl  
Jesus sister's eyes are a blister  
The High Street never looked so low  
It's the blind, leading the blond  
It's the cops collecting for the cons  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Where do we go  
Where do we go  
Jesus never let me down  
You know Jesus used to show me the score  
Then they put Jesus in show business  
Now it's hard to get in the door  
It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs  
But I guess it was something to go on  
So where is the hope and where is the faith  
And the love...what's that you say to me  
Does love...light up your Christmas Tree  
The next minute your blowing a fuse  
And the cartoon network turns into the news  
If God will send his angels  
I sure could use them here right now  
Well if God would send his angels  
Where do we go

I don't need to know  
And I don't want to promise  
And I don't want to lie  
I just want to feel the song

It's her daylight that gets me through

The moon was naked and cold  
I was like a two year old  
Who just wanted more

Tonight the moon has drawn its curtains  
It's a private show no one else going to know

It's sharp and it's clear  
But nothing at all like the moon  
  
It's okay  
The struggle for things not to say  
I never listened to you anyway  
And I got my own hands to pray  
  
If you wear that velvet dress

Who'll catch the star when it falls

Pity the nation that won't listen to your boys and girls

Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear?  
The right to be ridiculous is something I hold dear  
But change of heart comes slow

Nothing else about the place  
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face  
And it left me no illusion  
  
I saw you in the curve of the moon  
In the shadow cast across my room  
You heard me in my tune  
When I just heard confusion  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am...I am

I didn't give anyone else a choice  
An intellectual tortoise  
Racing with your bullet train  
  
Some people get squashed crossing the tracks  
Some people got high rises on their backs  
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks  
You can make me perfect again  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am...I am

Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline

Tidying the childrens clothes and toys  
You smiling back at me I took the photo from the fridge  
Can't remember what Emily did  
Haven't been with a woman, it feels like, for years  
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears  
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose  
The scent of it lingers but then it just goes

The best of us are geniuses of compression

I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home

Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank  
Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come  
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon  
  
Return the call to home

Unholy clouds reflect in a minaret  
So high above me, higher than everyone  
Where are you in the cedars of Lebanon?

Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you  
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends  
Gonna last with you longer than your friends

Don't change it  
See the sun rise over her skin  
Dawn changes everything  
Everything  
And the delta sun  
Burns bright and violet  
  
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat  
Sixty-six a highway speaks  
Of deserts dry  
Of cool green valleys  
Gold and silver veins  
Of the shining cities  
  
In this heartland  
In this heartland soil  
In this heartland  
Heaven knows this is a heartland  
Heartland...heartland  
  
See the sun rise over her skin  
She feels like water in my hand  
Freeway like a river cuts through this land  
Into the side of love  
Like a burning spear  
And the poison rain  
Brings a flood of fear  
Through the ghost-ranch hills  
Death valley waters  
In the towers of steel  
Belief goes on and on  
  
In this heartland  
In this heartland soil  
In this heartland  
Heaven knows this is a heartland

And a time that you listen  
Don't you beg the time on me  
They said you oughta call her back  
I want to, but afraid to say  
I won't hang up on you baby, child

All the time...  
Want a chance to hold you  
Want a chance to kill  
I want a chance to keep you awake at night  
When the sunlight burns through your love  
But you can't always get  
Everything you want  
You take cards from all under the table  
You're heaven, heaven and hell  
Baby you're heaven...heaven and hell  
Yeah, you're heaven...heaven and hell

And open up

And I want to paint it black  
No colors anymore  
I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by  
Dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head  
Until my darkness goes  
I see a line of cars  
And they're all painted black  
With flowers and my love  
Both never to come back  
I people turn their heads  
And quickly look away  
Like a newborn baby  
It just happens everyday  
I look inside myself  
See my heart is black  
I see my red door  
And I wanna paint it black  
Maybe then I'll fade away  
Not have to face the facts  
It's not easy facing up  
When your whole world is black  
No more will my green sea  
Will turn a deeper blue  
I could not foresee  
This thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough  
Into the setting sun  
My love will laugh with me  
Before the morning comes  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as night  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as coal

"Feel the wind burn through my skin  
The pain, the air is killing me  
For years my limbs stretched to the sky  
A nest for birds to sit and sing  
  
But now my branches suffer  
And my leaves don't bear the glow  
They did so long ago  
  
One day I was full of life  
My sap was rich and I was strong  
From seed to tree I grew so tall  
Through wind and rain I could not fall  
  
But now my branches suffer  
And my leaves don't offer  
Poetry to men of song  
  
Trees like me weren't meant to live  
If all this world can give  
Pollution and slow death  
  
Oh Lord I lay me down  
No life's left to be found  
There's nothing left for me  
  
Trees like me weren't meant to live  
If all this earth can give  
Is pollution  
  
Trees like me weren't meant to live  
(Oh Lord I lay me down)

They're all cousins friends and brothers  
And they make their Mamas cry  
They're record-making heart-breaking  
Just West Coast boys  
What I know it's a beginning of an endless harmony  
  
Striped shirt freedom  
Brave new worlds  
Go out on the road  
Where there's mid-sixties screaming  
And that nighttime holiday scheming  
While a lifestyle turns to gold  
Music's growing  
And vibrations showing  
What's it all mean  
I know it means there's an endless harmony  
  
And we sang God bless America  
It's a land where we tour  
She takes great care of us  
And people love for where we sing  
We sing...

"Frosty the snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, ""let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before i melt away""  
  
Down to the village  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying, ""catch me if you can""  
  
He led them down  
The streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment  
When he heard them holler, ""stop!""  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying, ""don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day""

She values flowers more than gold (She flows like gold)  
Thinks of her men as knights of old (She's never bold)  
She's very spiritual I'm told (She has never told)

But where's my spark in the dark?  
Glow glow glow see'mon glow

She'll always tell what's on your mind (She's much like time)  
By just your birthday place and time (She's very fine)  
  
Cause it's a silent night in the sea  
And if you're cosmic'ly conscious you'll see  
Why she's a princess incarnate to me  
Daughter of Neptune the ruler of the sea

It on

To remember when  
Her love filled my life  
Made my life alive her love  
Love around me  
How can I cope without the love  
That I had  
(all around me, love surrounds me)  
Surround me  
The love that I lost was more than  
I could hope to find  
(love surround me, all around me)  
Around me  
Did I have love or did love have me  
Oo love around me  
But there's no  
There's no love of my own  
Mmm mmmmm mmmmmmmmm  
Mm  
I gave up our love  
But it won't disappear  
Oo love around me

Seems as though  
Everywhere I go  
Oo love around me  
Put your arms around me  
Huggin' and a-kissin'  
Making the love I've been missin'  
All around me

"He sat up in his open window  
Looking quietly down at the path  
A firefly flew in his room and flew right out again  
  
Down jumped the prince  
And he went again to find his radio

As he made his way he could hear something once again

"I was working in the lab, late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
For my monster from his slab, began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
If you've ever seen a monster before  
Dancin' across the dance floor  
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout  
Turn around and help the monster turn it out  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
And if you don't have core hard cash  
You can still do the monster mash  
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring  
Seems he was troubled by just one thing  
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said  
""Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash  
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living this mash was meant too  
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash  
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash

"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,""  
I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, ""What else you got left?""  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, ""Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get.""  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, ""No, dear.""  
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum.""  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.

"How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I'd do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it's so hard to find  
One man in ten with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

Babe, I'd do it all over you.  
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years,

A millionaire's got a million dollars,

Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'

I'm lookin' forward to when I can do it all again  
And babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today,

I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,  
I'd even dance a jig on the ground.  
Well, everybody gets their hour,  
Everybody gets their time,

Even Sampson after he went blind.

Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.

After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do.  
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide

"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

Like the ocean's pounding roar.

"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view  
The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron  
Where beauty and pleasure were known.  
  
I spied a fair maid at her labour  
Which caused me to stay for a while  
And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".  
  
""Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".  
  
""Young maiden I wish not to banter  
It's true I come here in disguise  
I came here to fulfill our last promise  
And hope to give you a surprise.  
  
I've known you're a maid I love dearly  
And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel  
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"".

You're the only love I've ever known  
Just as long as you stay with me  
The whole world is my throne  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing we can call our own  
  
Well, I'm moving after midnight  
Down boulevards of broken cars  
Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass  
We'll keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me, pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said

"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun  
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

Night time, day time,  
Any time you want.  
  
Sometimes I'm thinkin'  
I'm too high to fall.  
Sometimes I'm thinkin'  
I'm too high to fall.  
Other times I'm thinkin' I'm  
So low I don't know  
If I can come up at all.  
  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway.  
Black crows in the meadow  
Across a broad highway.  
Though it's funny, honey,  
I just don't feel much like a  
Scarecrow today.

"Seen the arrow on the doorpost  
Saying, ""This land is condemned  
All the way from New Orleans  
To Jerusalem. ""  
I traveled through East Texas  
Where many martyrs fell  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing  
As they were taking down the tents  
The stars above the barren trees  
Were his only audience  
Them charcoal gypsy maidens  
Can strut their feathers well  
But nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
See them big plantations burning  
Hear the cracking of the whips  
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming  
(And) see the ghosts of slavery ships  
I can hear them tribes a-moaning  
(I can) hear the undertaker's bell  
(Yeah), nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
There's a woman by the river  
With some fine young handsome man  
He's dressed up like a squire  
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand  
There's a chain gang on the highway  
I can hear them rebels yell  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
Well, God is in heaven  
And we all want what's his  
But power and greed and corruptible seed  
Seem to be all that there is  
I'm gazing out the window  
Of the St. James Hotel  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell

"How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you can call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand?  
Yes, how many times must the cannon balls fly  
Before they're forever banned?  
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
  
Yes, how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it's washed to the sea?  
Yes, how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free?  
Yes, how many times can a man turn his head  
Pretending he just doesn't see?

Yes, how many times must a man look up  
Before he can really see the sky?  
Yes, how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry?  
Yes, how many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died?

"While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

"By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At one-oh-three.

"He sits in your room, his tomb with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursin' the dead that can't answer him back  
You know he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his business-like anger and bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.

"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

"Everybody's asking why he couldn't adjust  
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said what's up is down, they said what isn't is  
They put ideas in his head that he thought were his.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made him a killer  
That's what they did.  
  
He was on the basketball team, he was in the marching band  
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""  
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up.  
  
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills  
A jeep to drive, blood to spill.  
  
They said, ""Congratulation, you got what it takes""  
They sent him back into the race without any brakes.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him

He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt  
Only game he could play was Russian Roulette.  
  
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread  
He ate Burger Kings, he was well fed.  
  
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O'Toole  
He stole a Rolls Royce and drove in a pool.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He could've sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar  
He could've been an accountant or a tennis star.  
  
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day  
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay.  
  
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans  
They gotta sleep together in a home they don't own.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
Everybody's asking why he didn't adjust  
All he wanted was somebody to trust.  
  
They took his head and turned it inside out  
He never did know what it was all about.  
  
He had a steady job, he joined the choir  
He never did plan to walk the high wire.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him That's what they did.

"After a while we took in the clothes,  
Nobody said very much.  
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants  
Which nobody really wanted to touch.  
Mama come in and picked up a book  
An' Papa asked her what it was.  
Someone else asked, ""What do you care?""  
Papa said, ""Well, just because.""  
Then they started to take back their clothes,  
Hang 'em on the line.  
It was January the thirtieth  
And everybody was feelin' fine.  
  
The next day everybody got up  
Seein' if the clothes were dry.  
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,  
Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi!""  
""Have you heard the news?"" he said, with a grin,  
""The Vice-President's gone mad!""  
""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night.""  
""Hmm, say, that's too bad!""  
""Well, there's nothin' we can do about it,"" said the neighbor,  
""It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.""  
""Yes, I guess so,"" said Ma,  
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.  
  
I reached up, touched my shirt,  
And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?""  
I said, ""Some of 'em, not all of 'em.""  
He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""  
I said, ""Sometime, not all the time.""  
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose  
Just as papa yelled outside,  
""Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.""  
Well, I just do what I'm told,  
So, I did it, of course.  
I went back in the house and Mama met me  
And then I shut all the doors.

Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way

I live in another world where life and death are memorized  
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

My dreams are beyond control.  
When that steamboat whistle blows,  
I'm gonna give you all I got to give,  
And I do hope you receive it well,  
Dependin' on the way you feel that you live.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please heed these words that I speak.  
I know you've suffered much,  
But in this you are not so unique.  
All of us, at times, we might work too hard  
To have it too fast and too much,  
And anyone can fill his life up  
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please don't dismiss my case.  
I'm not about to argue,  
I'm not about to move to no other place.  
Now, each of us has his own special gift  
And you know this was meant to be true,  
And if you don't underestimate me,  
I won't underestimate you.

"Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'Til someone will let me ride  
If I can't find my baby I'm gonna run away and hide  
Well, I been pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
pacing round the room, hoping maybe she come back  
Well, I been praying for salvation  
Laying round in a one-room country shack  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
Gonna walk down that dirt road, until my eyes begin to bleed  
'Til there's nothing left to see  
'Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed  
But I'm looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above  
looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above  
Rolling through the rain and hail  
Looking for the sunny side of love  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
Gonna walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same  
I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my name

"There's a whole lot of people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right down the highway straight down the line  
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind  
Nothing about it that's sweet  
The disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Steps into your eats into your soul  
Over your senses you have no control  
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count  
From the outside world the pressure will mount  
Turn you into a piece of meat  
The disease of conceit.  
  
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure.  
  
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that you're too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit.

"Said the night wind to the little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know?  
In your palace warm, mighty king  
Do you know what I know?

Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold

Pray for peace, people, everywhere  
Listen to what I say!

He will bring us goodness and light

Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?  
Do you think we can talk about it some more?

Maybe I'd have done some good in the world

My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I can't move.

Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight

An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe

Look out your window and I'll be gone

To try and make me change my mind and stay

So don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
Like you never did before  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal

I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But don't think twice, it's all right  
  
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound, I can't tell  
But goodbye's too good a word, gal  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  
You could have done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
But don't think twice, it's all right

"""Oh, help me in my weakness,""  
I heard the drifter say,  
As they carried him from the courtroom  
And were taking him away.  
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong.""  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
""You fail to understand,"" he said,  
""Why must you even try?""  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
""The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse.""  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.

Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

"Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun  
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one  
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind the closed door  
But I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
Come baby, rock me, come baby, locl me into the shadows of your heart  
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start  
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for  
And I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
It's like my whole life never happened  
When I see you, it's if I never had a thought  
I know this dream, it might be crazy  
But it's the only one I got. Okay.  
  
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied  
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide  
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores  
But I will always be emotionally yours.

"Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know

It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke

And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know

Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train

I never can go, because you know

Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine  
If you go when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin' winds  
Please see if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long  
For that's the way I remember her best

In the darkness of my night

I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.  
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street  
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.  
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room  
With a golden loom.  
  
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.  
I see the hungry clouds up above your face  
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.  
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom.  
  
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light  
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.  
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail  
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.  
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom.

"Gonna change my way of thinking,  
Make myself a different set of rules.  
Gonna change my way of thinking,

Gonna put my good foot forward,  
And stop being influenced by fools.  
  
So much oppression,  
Can't keep track of it no more.  
So much oppression,  
Can't keep track of it no more.  
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers,  
And old men turning young daughters into whores.  
  
Stripes on your shoulders,  
Stripes on your back and on your hands.  
Stripes on your shoulders,  
Stripes on your back and on your hands.  
Swords piercing your side,  
Blood and water flowing through the land.  
  
Well don't know which one is worse,  
Doing your own thing or just being cool.  
Well don't know which one is worse,  
Doing your own thing or just being cool.

You forget all about the golden rule.

You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.

A place where there is no pain of birth.

Are lined with gold

"Well, I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.  
While sailing 'round the ocean,  
While sailing 'round the sea  
I'd think of handsome molly  
Wherever she might be.  
Don't you remember, molly  
You gave me your right hand?  
You said whenever you'd marry  
I would be the man.  
But you broke your promise  
Go with whom you please  
My poor heart is aching  
You are at your ease.  
I went to church last Sunday  
Molly came ridin' by  
I could tell her mind was changin'  
By the rovin' of her eye.  
I go down to the river  
Though everyone's asleep  
I think of handsome molly  
An' I begin to weep.  
So I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.

With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in

"Well met, well met, my own true love  
Well met, well met, cried she  
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea  
And it's all for the love of thee  
  
I could have married a King's daughter there  
She would have married me  
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there  
It's all for the love of thee  
  
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there  
I'm sure you're the one to blame  
For I am married to a house carpenter  
And I'm sure he's a fine young man  
  
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter  
And come away with me  
I'll take you where the green grass grows  
On the shores of sunny Italy  
  
So up she picked her babies three  
And gave them kisses, one, two, three  
Saying ""take good care of your daddy while I'm gone  
And keep him good company.""  
  
Well, they were sailin' about two weeks  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck  
Sayin' she wants company  
  
""Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?  
Or are you weepin' for your babies three?""  
""Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter  
I'm weepin' for my babies three.""  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as white as snow  
Those are the hill of heaven, my love  
You and I'll never know  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as dark as night  
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love  
Where you and I will unite  
  
Oh twice around went the gallant ship  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak  
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea

"[Chorus]  
Oh, I can't get you off of my mind  
When I try I 'm just wastin' my time  
Lord I've tried and I've tried  
and all night long I've cried  
But I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
Didn't think you would leave me behind  
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind  
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool ev'ry new love you find  
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies  
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.

Looking far off into the east  
And I see my baby comin'  
She's walking with the village beast  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the last part of the day's already gone  
  
We got so much in common  
We strive for the same old ends  
And I just can't wait  
Wait for us to become friends  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well life is for love  
And they say that love is blind  
If you wanna live easy  
Baby, pack your clothes with mine  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well now what's the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
You're the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And I'm reading James Joyce  
Some people they tell me  
I got the blood of the land in my voice  
  
Everybody got all the money  
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers  
I don't have one single rose  
I feel a change comin' on

But if you got to go, go now,

To take part in any quiz.

An' you keep askin' me what time it is.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
I am just a poor boy, baby,  
Lookin' to connect.  
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'  
That I ain't got any respect.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
You know I'd have nightmares  
And a guilty conscience, too,  
If I kept you from anything  
That you really wanted to do.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm wantin'  
Anything you never gave before.  
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,  
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.

"I was in your presence for an hour or so  
Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.

And if I don't make it

For so much had he to give  
  
But his life is through  
For the story told is true  
For he died just as he lived  
  
For this daring young star  
Met his death while in his car  
No one knows the reason why  
  
Screaming tire, flashing fire  
And gone was this young star  
Oh how could they let him die  
  
Still a young man is gone  
Yet his legend lingers on  
For he died without a cause

Be known for evermore

"A child of winter  
A child of the snow  
I'm making a snowball  
That someone will throw  
I'm making a snowman  
With charcoal for the eyes  
A scarf draped in red  
And a derby on his head  
  
Here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus  
Right down santa claus lane  
Vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer are pulling on the reins  
Bells are ringing, children singing  
All is merry and bright  
Hang your stockings and say your prayers  
'cause santa claus comes tonight  
  
The evening of christmas  
Presents have been passed  
The wood in the fireplace  
Is glowing its last  
I'm closing my eyes now  
In my bed I'm snuggling  
Outside my window  
The carolers sing  
  
Christmas comes and the snow covers all  
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights  
Mama's in the kitchen making cookies and bread  
The children are hungry, they're waiting to be fed  
  
A child of christmas  
A child of snow  
A wonderful feeling  
Underneath the mistletoe  
And may your christmas  
Last all year  
With laughter of children  
Peace and cheer  
  
A child of christmas  
A child of snow  
A wonderful feeling  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Merry christmas to you

The county fair comes our way  
Where the folks gather round to be happy and spend their day  
A-here's what happened now,  
I soon decide that I'd take with me

I had her pack us a lunch and on down the dirt road we flew  
  
(Hurry hurry, step right up and win your girl a stuffed koala bear)

Right then I knew what I had to do  
(Hurry, hurry)  
Before that day was through  
(Step right up)  
I had to win a stuffed doggie or I'd break her poor heart in two  
(Hurry, hurry)  
(Win a prize)  
A let me tell you now,  
I passed up a chance when I walked by a booth  
(Hurry, hurry)  
Where you throw a dart and break a balloon  
(Step right up)  
I snuck by a couple more, but I had to get caught real soon  
(Hurry, hurry)

I tried again and again, but I just didn't do so well  
(Hurry, hurry)  
(Win a prize)  
Can you believe it now,  
Up walked a fella and he tapped me on the shoulder, said  
(Hurry, hurry)  
I can win your girl a prize  
(Step right up)  
So, he flexed all his muscles and knocked the bell up in the sky  
(Hurry, hurry)  
(Win a prize)  
  
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky  
(Hurry, hurry)  
Took my girl and the doggie away  
(Step right up...)  
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky  
(Step right up son, test your strength)  
Took my girl and the doggie away

Engulfs all the senses  
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose  
Retire the fences  
Whether wholly heartened life fades away  
Whether harps heal the memory  
Whether wholly heartened life fades away  
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side  
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

All the people live and love there by the sea  
Near the sparkling wather 'neath the coco-palm tree  
  
Island girl she make me happy  
Island girl she kinda sassy  
Island girl won't you show me the way  
  
She's fine so fine all mine

And I know (i know) our love (or love) so free (so free)

She's a real beauty from the caribbean  
Long dark hair flowin' in the breeze  
She's the kinda beauty makes you come alive and  
We can live together for eternity  
  
Every now and then I get this silly grin  
When I'm there in her company  
She says I'm crazy that I'm also very lazy  
I know she loves me

The music spinning in our head  
Can't forget the feeling of  
The magic of that summer love  
Ooh I wanna take you there  
Do you wanna turn back the pages  
Memories in photographs  
The world is changed  
And yet the game is still the same

How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
All of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh

Now's the time to let them happen again  
We can have ourselves a blast  
Good times that aren't only in the past

Way back up in the woods up near the evergreens

To let my soul automatically soar  
But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Sew up the wounds of evolution  
And the now starts to get in my way  
So what if life's a revelation  
If the mind speaks of only today  
So real, the pain growing in my soul  
Of climbing up to reality's goal  
But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Long promised road  
Trail starts at dawn  
Carries on to the season's ending  
Long promised road  
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending  
So hard to lift the jeweled sceptre  
When the weight turns a smile to a frown  
So hard to drink of passion nectar  
When the taste of life's holding me down  
So hard to plant the seed of reform  
To set my sights on defeating the storm  
So I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

One by one, until there were none.  
Two by two, to their lovers they flew,  
Two by two, into the foggy dew.  
Three by three, they danced on the sea,  
Four by four, they danced on the shore,  
Five by five, they tried to survive,  
Six by six, they were playing with tricks.

How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?  
How much poison did they inhale?

"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
And where have you been my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'  
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony  
I met a white man who walked a black dog  
I met a young woman whose body was burning  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow  
I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And what'll you do now my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'  
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest  
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color, where none is the number  
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it  
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'  
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

"I can hear the turning of the key  
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.  
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain  
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.  
  
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost  
He's always off somewhere when I need him most.  
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill  
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still.  
  
I come back to the town from the flaming moon  
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.  
I love to see you dress before the mirror  
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?  
  
Everybody's wearing a disguise  
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.  
But me, I can't cover what I am  
Wherever the children go I'll follow them.  
  
I march in the parade of liberty  
But as long as I love you I'm not free.  
How long must I suffer such abuse  
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?  
  
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,  
The pot of gold is only make-believe.  
The treasure can't be found by men who search  
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.  
  
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,  
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.  
My head tells me it's time to make a change  
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.  
  
One more time at midnight, near the wall  
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.  
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?  
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.

But ev'rybody else, even yourself

The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine  
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain  
Someone hit me from behind  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through this weary world of woe  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
No one on earth would ever know  
  
They say prayer has the power to heal  
So pray from the mother  
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell

My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
I'll just slaughter 'em where they lie  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' through the cities of the plague.  
  
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down

Eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.

Some day you'll be glad to have me around.

Every waking moment you could crack  
I'll make the most of one last extra hour  
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Hand me down my walkin' cane.

Got to get you out of my miserable brain.  
  
All my loyal and my much-loved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned  
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.  
  
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'  
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Carryin' a dead man's shield  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin' is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending  
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Walkin' ever since the other night.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon  
There's no one here, the gardener is gone  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Up the road, around the bend.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
In the last outback at the world's end.

"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,  
""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.  
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,  
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""  
  
""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,  
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.  
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""

While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.  
  
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,  
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

Oh yeah!  
Underneath that tree  
There's just gonna be you and me  
Underneath that apple suckling tree  
Oh yeah!  
  
Now, who's on the table. who's to tell me?  
Oh yeah!  
Who's on the table, who's to tell me?  
Oh yeah!  
Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell?  
The forty-nine of you like bats out of hell  
Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree

"Are you ready, are you ready?  
Are you ready, are you ready?  
  
Are you ready to meet Jesus?  
Are you where you ought to be?  
Will He know you when He sees you  
Or will He say, ""Depart from Me""?  
  
Are you ready, hope you're ready  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
  
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren  
And to take up my cross?  
Have I surrendered to the will of God  
Or am I still like the boss?  
  
Am I ready, hope I'm ready.  
When the destruction cometh swiftly  
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well  
Have you decided whether you want to be  
In heaven or in hell?  
  
Are you ready, are you ready?  
Have you got some unfinished business?  
Is there something holding you back?  
Are you thinking for yourself  
Or are you following the pack?  
  
Are you ready, hope you're ready  
Are you ready?  
  
Are you ready for the judgment?  
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?  
Are you ready for Armageddon?  
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?  
  
Are you ready, I hope you're ready?

"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,  
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp  
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,  
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.  
  
""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.  
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,  
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,  
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,  
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,  
And drink the king's health in the morning.  
  
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,  
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,  
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,  
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',  
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,  
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.  
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,  
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""  
  
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,  
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,  
But you dare not change them one night, for you know  
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,  
And although that we're single and free,  
We take great delight in our own company,  
We have no desire strange places to see,  
Although that your offers are charming.  
  
""And we have no desire to take your advance,  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,  
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,  
Where we would get shot without warning,""  
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,  
For if you insult me with one other word,  
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""  
  
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning.  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,  
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,  
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""  
  
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,  
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,  
And bade it a tedious returning,  
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,  
And left them for dead in the morning.  
  
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.  
  
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'

"As I went out one morning  
To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,  
I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains.  
I offer'd her my hand,  
She took me by the arm.  
I knew that very instant,  
She meant to do me harm.  
  
""Depart from me this moment,""  
I told her with my voice.  
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""  
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""  
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth,  
""I will secretly accept you  
And together we'll fly south.""  
  
Just then Tom Paine, himself,  
Came running from across the field,  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield.  
And as she was letting go her grip,  
Up Tom Paine did run,  
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,  
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna back up against the wall  
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna run till I have to crawl  
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothin' at all  
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said  
Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.  
  
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change my house around  
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna make a change in this here town  
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna change the world around  
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said  
Oh babe, I'm in the mood for you.

"Sad I'm sittin' on the railroad track,  
Watchin' that old smokestack.  
Train is a-leavin' but it won't be back.  
  
Years ago we hang around,  
Watchin' trains roll through the town.  
Now that train is a-graveyard bound.  
  
Where we go up in that North country,  
Lakes and streams and mines so free,  
I had no better friend than he.  
  
Something happened to him that day,  
I thought I heard a stranger say,  
I hung my head and stole away.  
  
A diesel truck was headin' down,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
It left him on a Utah road.  
  
They carried him back to his home town,  
His mother cried, his sister moaned,  
Listenin' to them church bells tone.  
  
A diesel truck was rollin' slow,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
And it left him on a Utah road.

"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

"You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand  
You see somebody naked and you say, ""Who is that man?""  
You try so hard but you don't understand  
Just what you will say when you get home  
Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You raise up your head and you ask, ""Is this where it is?""  
And somebody points to you and says, ""It's his""  
And you say, ""What's mine?"" and somebody else says, ""Well, what is?""  
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""  
But something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek  
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak  
And says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?""  
And you say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone  
And something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks  
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination  
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you to all give a check  
To tax-deductible charity organizations  
  
Ah, you've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks  
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks  
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books  
You're very well-read, it's well-known  
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels  
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels  
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels  
And he says, ""Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan""  
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word ""Now""  
And you say, ""For what reason?"" and he says, ""How""  
And you say, ""What does this mean?"" and he screams back, ""You're a cow!  
Give me some milk or else go home""  
And you know something's happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown  
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground  
There ought to be a law against you comin' around  
You should be made to wear earphones  
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?

"Bessie was more than just a friend of mine

Was it her sweet love or the way that she could sing  
  
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie  
Oh, See her soon  
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I wonder what she'll do  
  
There's so much time has gone right on by  
I didn't think one could be so wrong  
And then one night I was drinkin' and a-thinkin'  
In the bottom of the glass I could see Bessie's face so strong  
  
I'm just goin' down the road t' see Bessie  
Oh, See her soon  
Goin' down the road t' see Bessie Smith  
When I get there I wonder what she'll do  
  
When she sees me will she know what I've been through?  
Will old times start to feelin' like new?  
When I get there will our love still feel so true?  
Yet all I have, I'll be a-bringin' it to you

"They pave paradise, they put up a parking lot  
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot

"Up on the white veranda  
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.  
Her passport shows a face  
From another time and place  
She looks nothing like that.  
And all the remnants of her recent past  
Are scattered in the wild wind.  
She walks across the marble floor  
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.  
She smiles, walks the other way  
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down  
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.  
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,  
Carefully removes his fez,  
""Am I hearing you right?""  
And as the yellow fog is lifting  
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.  
She passes him on the spiral staircase  
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador,  
She starts to speak, but he walks away  
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
A soldier sits beneath the fan  
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.  
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.  
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,  
""Can you see anything?""  
Then the Greek appears on the second floor  
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,  
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,  
Says, ""Open up another deck.""  
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''  
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh  
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.  
He tried to grab the woman's hand,  
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""  
She said, ""That ain't enough.""  
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags  
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.  
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,  
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""  
She knocked upon it anyway  
As the sun went down and the music did play  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""  
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.  
He hung there from the chandelier.  
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near  
Please open up the door!""  
Then the volcano erupted  
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.  
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner  
Thinking of forbidden love.  
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""  
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the island slowly sank  
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.  
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.  
You can take your money, but I don't know how  
You'll spend it in the tomb.""  
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear  
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,  
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,  
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""  
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray  
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,  
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.  
It seems there was an earthquake that  
Left nothing but a Panama hat  
And a pair of old Greek shoes.  
Didn't seem like much was happening,  
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.  
Seems like every time you turn around  
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
And I never did plan to go anyway  
To Black Diamond Bay.

"Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back,  
A-whistlin' loud and merry.

Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight,  
Till he came to a river ragin',  
And there he spied his darlin' bride  
In the arms of Black Jack Davey.  
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey.  
  
""Pull off, pull off them long blue gloves  
All made of the finest leather.  
Give to me your lily-white hand  
And we'll both go home together.  
We'll both go home together.""  
  
Well, she pulled off them long blue gloves  
All made of the finest leather.  
Gave to him her lily-white hand  
And said good-bye forever.  
Bid farewell forever.  
  
""Would you forsake your house and home,  
Would you forsake your baby?  
Would you forsake your husband, too,  
To go with Black Jack Davey.  
Rode off with Black Jack Davey?""  
  
""Well, I'll forsake my house and home,  
And I'll forsake my baby.  
I'll forsake my husband, too,  
For the love of Black Jack Davey.  
Ride off with Black Jack Davey.""  
  
""Last night I slept in a feather bed  
Between my husband and baby.  
Tonight I lay on the river banks  
In the arms of Black Jack Davey,  
Love my Black Jack Davey.""

"Woke up this morning, feeling blue,  
Seen a good-lookin' girl, can I make love with you?  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.  
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe,  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
I went back home, put on my tie,  
Gonna get that girl that money that money will buy.  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,  
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.  
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe,

She looked at me, begin to smile,  
Said, ""Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?""  
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,  
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you.  
Got blood in my eyes for you, babe,  
I don't care what in the world you do.  
  
No, no, ma'ma, I can't wait,

"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.  
  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayet for someone I really could care for.  
  
And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""  
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own  
Without a love of my own.

"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land  
I yelled down to Captain Arab, I'll have ya understand,  
Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -  
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""  
""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,  
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.  
  
""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.  
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said ""Let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.  
  
Aw, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how,  
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin' ""BAN THE BUMS!"".  
I jumped right in line, sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""  
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook -  
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.  
I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -  
Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.  
  
I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.  
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.  
  
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.  
I said ""Can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.""  
The man said ""Get out of here or I'll tear you limb from limb.""  
I said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""You're not him.  
Get out of here before I break your bones. I'm not your pop.""  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.  
He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.  
A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -  
When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.  
I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.  
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.  
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.  
They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.  
I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""  
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,  
But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -  
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a
truck??  
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said ""Good luck...""

"Oh, I'm sailin' away my own true love,  
I'm sailin' away in the morning.  
Is there something I can send you from across the sea,  
From the place that I'll be landing?  
  
No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love,  
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'.  
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled,  
From across that lonesome ocean.  
  
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine  
Made of silver or of golden,  
Either from the mountains of Madrid  
Or from the coast of Barcelona.  
  
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night  
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean,  
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss,  
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.  
  
That I might be gone a long time  
And it's only that I'm askin',  
Is there something I can send you to remember me by,  
To make your time more easy passin'.  
  
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again,  
It only brings me sorrow.  
The same thing I want from you today,  
I would want again tomorrow.  
  
I got a letter on a lonesome day,  
It was from her ship a-sailin',  
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again,  
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.  
  
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way,  
I'm sure your mind is roamin'.  
I'm sure your heart is not with me,  
But with the country to where you're goin'.  
  
So take heed, take heed of the western wind,  
Take heed of the stormy weather.  
And yes, there's something you can send back to me,  
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.  
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,

And hard like an oak  
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.  
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,  
If you want me, honey baby,  
I'll be here.  
  
Like your smile  
And your fingertips  
Like the way that you move your lips.  
I like the cool way you look at me,  
Everything about you is bringing me  
Misery.  
  
Little red wagon  
Little red bike  
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.  
I like the way you love me strong and slow,  
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,  
When I go.  
  
Life is sad  
Life is a bust  
All ya can do is do what you must.  
You do what you must do and ya do it well,

You know I always understand  
  
Call girls in the doorway  
All giving me the eye

All giving me the eye  
But my heart's just not in it

"Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl,  
She's all in her tender years.  
She fell in love with a sailor boy,  
It's true she loved him well.  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how,  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy,  
All for a piece of gold.  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold,  
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,  
Your jacket shall be blue.  
You'll see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the other sailors heard the news,  
Well, they fell into a rage,  
And with all the ship's company  
They were willing to engage.  
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,  
Overboard we'll throw her.  
She'll never see that seaport town  
Called Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the captain he heard the news,  
Well, he too fell in a rage,  
And with the whole ship's company  
He was willing to engage,  
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,  
Her color shall be blue,  
She'll see that seaport town  
Call Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely 'bout half a year,  
She's married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear.  
She's dressed in silks and satins now,  
She cuts a gallant show,  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadee-i-o.  
  
Come, all you fair and tender girls,  
Wheresoever you may be,  
I'd have you to follow your own true love  
Whene'er he goes to sea.  
For if the sailors prove false to you,  
Well, the captain, he might prove true.  
You'll see the honor I have gained  
By the wearing of the blue.

"I can't wait  
Wait for you to change my mind  
It's late  
I'm tryin' to walk the line  
  
Well it's way past midnight  
And there's some people all around  
Some on their way up  
Some on their way down  
  
The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
I'm your man  
I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew  
  
You understand  
That my heart can't go on beating without you  
Well your loveliness has wounded me  
I'm reeling from the blow  
  
I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so  
I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
Skies are gray  
  
I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow  
Night or day  
It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go  
If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do  
  
I'd like to think I could control myself  
But it isn't true  
That's how it is  
When things disintegrate  
  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
I'm doomed to love you  
I been rollin' through stormy weather  
I'm thinkin' of you  
  
And all the places we could roam together  
It's mighty funny  
The end of time has just begun  
Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one  
  
Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind  
I left my life with you  
Somewhere back there along the line  
I thought somehow that I would be spared this day  
  
I don't know how much longer I can wait

"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost  
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.  
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.  
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,  
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain  
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.  
  
Was she a child or a woman, I can't say which  
From one to another she could to easily switch  
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.  
Could I been used and played as a pawn?  
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on  
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore  
She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,  
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.""  
He was well connected but her heart was a snare  
And she had left him to die in there,  
There were payments due and he was a little behind.  
  
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,  
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,  
Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""  
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,  
She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing  
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea  
I hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me,  
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.  
Every new messenger brings evil report  
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short  
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.  
  
Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose.  
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes  
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin' on.  
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,  
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.  
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

"In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty,  
I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind.  
To feel you all around me,  
And to take your hand along the sand,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When sundown pales the sky,  
I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,  
I want you near, to kill my fears,  
To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

"The jingle bells are jingling  
The streets  
Are white with snow  
The happy crowds are mingling  
But there's no one that I know  
  
I'm sure that you'll forgive me  
If I don't enthuse  
I guess  
I've got the Christmas blues  
  
I've done my window shopping  
There's not a store I've missed  
But what's the use of stopping  
When there's no one on your list  
  
You'll know the way I'm feeling  
When you love and you lose  
I guess  
I've got the Christmas blues  
  
When somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Christmas is a joy of joys  
But friends when you're lonely  
You'll find that it's only  
A thing for little girls  
And little boys  
  
May all your days be merry  
Your seasons full of cheer  
But 'til it's January  
I'll just go and disappear  
Oh Santa  
May have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes  
  
But Santa only brought me  
The blues  
Those brightly packaged  
Tinsel covered  
Christmas blues

Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.  
  
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.  
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up  
And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,  
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.  
  
Covenant woman, intimate little girl  
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.  
You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.  
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.

"I cross the green mountain  
I sit by the stream  
Heaven blazing in my head  
I, I dreamt a monstrous dream  
  
Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end?  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rapper's land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God  
  
The world is old  
The world is great  
Lessons of life  
Can't be learned in a day  
  
I watch and I wait  
And I listen while I stand  
To the music that comes  
From a far better land  
  
Close the eyes of our captain  
Peace may he know  
His long night is done  
The great leader is laid low  
  
He was ready to fall  
He was quick to defend  
Killed outright he was  
By his own men  
  
It's the last day's last hour  
Of the last happy year  
I feel that the unknown  
The world is so dear  
  
Pride will vanish  
And glory will rot  
But virtue lives  
And cannot be forgot  
  
The bells  
Of evening have rung  
There's blasphemy  
On the end of the tongue  
  
Let them say that I walked  
In fair nature's light  
And that I was loyal  
To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full  
Look upward beyond  
Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses  
And the blood stained woods  
They never dreamed of surrendering  
They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama  
I saw each star  
You're walking in dreams  
Whoever you are  
  
Chilled are the skies  
Keen is the frost  
The ground's froze hard  
And the morning is lost  
  
A letter to mother  
Came today  
Gunshot wound to the breast  
Is what it did say  
  
But he'll be better soon  
He's in a hospital bed  
But he'll never be better  
He's already dead  
  
I'm ten miles outside the city  
And I'm lifted away  
In an ancient light  
That is not of day  
  
They were calm, they were gloomed  
We knew them all too well  
We loved each other more than  
We ever dared to tell

",Bob Dylan
"Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,  
The birdies were flying from tree to tree.  
There was little to say, there was no conversation  
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.  
And the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,  
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.  
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',  
But the next time I looked there was light in the room.  
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,  
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',  
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees.  
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,  
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.  
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,  
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,  
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,  
Sure was glad to get out of there alive.  
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
And the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me,  
Singing for me, well, singing for me.

"I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days  
They call me a bummer and a gin shot too, but what cares I for praise ?  
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign  
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew  
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true  
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine  
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight  
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight  
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein  
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game  
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same  
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind  
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget  
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet  
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design  
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast  
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost  
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign  
""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

"Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind,  
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine,  
Never bein' able to separate the good from the bad,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
It's makin' me feel so bad.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
Satan got you by the heel, there's a bird's nest in your hair.  
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?  
The way that you hold your head, cursin' God with every move,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
What are you tryin' to prove?  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
The glamor ad the bright lights and the politics of sin,  
The ghetto you build for me is the one you end up in,  
The race of the engine that overrules your heart,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
Pretending that you're so smart.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.  
  
What are you tryin' to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?  
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?  
The tuxedo that you're wearin', the flower in your lapel,  
Ooh, I can't stand it, I can't stand it,  
You want to take me down to hell.  
  
Dead man, dead man,  
When will you rise?  
Cobwebs in your mind,  
Dust in your eyes.

"When you're sad and lonely  
And you haven't got a friend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all that you hell sacred  
Falls down and dows not bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When you're standing at the cross-roads  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And there's nowhere there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Oh the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Shines in dark and empty skies  
  
When the cities are on fire  
When the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is nt the end  
And you search in vain to find  
  
Just one law abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.

"Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,  
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West,  
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned,  
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low,  
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,  
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white,  
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Judge says to Curtis, ""What's this noise about?""  
""All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out.""  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis said to the judge, ""What might be my fine?""  
Judge says, ""Poor boy, you got ninety-nine.""  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup,  
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.

"They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting  
the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in  
town  
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a  
trance  
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in  
his pants  
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to  
go  
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row  
  
Cinderella, she seems so easy, ""It takes one to know one,""  
she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style  
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. ""You Belong to Me I  
Believe""  
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend, you  
Better leave""  
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go  
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row  
  
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to  
hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things  
inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready  
for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row  
  
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so  
afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row  
  
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a  
trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
  
As he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
  
Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, ""Have Mercy on His  
Soul""  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row""  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, ""Which Side Are You On?""  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row

"Now There's a man you'll hear about  
Most anywhere you go,  
And his holdings are in Texas  
And his name is Diamond Joe.  
  
And he carries all his money  
In a diamond-studded jar.  
He never took much trouble  
With the process of the law.  
  
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,  
Did offer him my hand,  
He gave a string of horses  
So old they could not stand.  
  
And I nearly starved to death, boys,  
He did mistreat me so,  
And I never saved a dollar  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
Now his bread it was corn dodger  
And his meat you couldn't chaw,  
Nearly drove me crazy  
With the wagging of his jaw.  
  
And the telling of his story,  
Mean to let you know  
That there never was a rounder  
That could lie like Diamond Joe.  
  
Now, I tried three times to quit him,  
But he did argue so  
I'm still punching cattle  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
And when I'm called up yonder  
And it's my time to go,  
Give my blankets to my buddies  
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

"If I had wings like Noah's dove  
I'd fly the river to the one I love

I had a man, who was long and tall,  
Moved his body like a cannon ball.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
'Member one evening, it was drizzling rain  
And in my heart I felt an aching pain.

You can't care the bloody for my unborn child.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed  
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.  
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,  
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.  
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,  
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

Is really bad  
Like being  
In the bottom  
Of a stream  
Any minute now  
I'm expecting  
To wake up  
From a dream  
Miss so much  
The softest touch  
Like the grave  
Of some child child  
Who neither wept  
Nor smiled  
I'm hiding my faith  
In the rain  
I've been  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Somewhere dawn  
Is breaking  
Light is streaking  
Across the floor  
Church bells  
Are ringing  
I wonder who  
They're ringing for  
Travel under any star  
You'll see me  
Wherever you are  
  
The shadowy past  
Is so vague and so vast  
I'm sleeping  
In the balance of pain  
I've been dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Maybe they'll get me  
Maybe they won't  
But whatever  
It won't be tonight  
I wish your hand  
Was in mine right now  
We could go  
Where the moon is wide  
  
For years  
They had me  
Locked in a cage  
Then they threw me  
Onto the stage  
Somethings  
Just last longer  
Then you  
Thought they would  
And they never  
Ever explain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Well  
I eat when I'm hungry  
Drink when I'm dry  
Live my life  
On the square  
Even if the flesh  
Falls off my face  
It won't matter as long  
As you're there  
  
Feel like  
A ghost in love  
Underneath  
The heavens above  
Feel further away  
Then I ever did before  
Feel further  
Than I can take  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Everything in the way  
Is so shy like the day  
In queer and unusual form  
Spirals of golden haze here  
In there in a blaze  
Like beams of light  
In a star  
  
Maybe you're here  
Or maybe you weren't  
Maybe you  
Touched somebody  
And got burned  
The silent sun  
Has got me on the run  
Burning a hole  
In my brain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane

",Bob Dylan
"I didn't know that you'd be leavin'  
Or who you thought you were talkin' to.  
I figure maybe we're even  
Or maybe I'm one up on you.  
  
I send you all my money  
Just like I did before.  
I tried to reach you honey,  
But you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
I ain't gonna get lost in this current,  
I don't like playing cat and mouse.  
No gentleman likes making love to a servant.  
Especially when he's in his father's house.  
  
I never could guess your weight, baby,  
Never needed to call you my whore.  
I always thought you were straight, baby,  
But you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted,  
The bottom of the barrel is too.  
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.  
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.  
  
Never no more do I wonder,  
Why you don't never play with me any more.  
At any moment you could go under,  
Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
You and me we had completeness,  
I give you all of what I could provide  
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,  
We were the wrong side.  
  
I've already ripped out the phones, honey.  
You can't walk the streets in a war.  
I can finish this alone, honey,  
You're driftin' too far from shore.

",Bob Dylan
"Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away  
I wanna stop at Carmangale and keep on going  
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day  
  
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp  
But I ain't neither one  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Sounding like it's on a final run  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she never blowed before  
Little light blinking, red light glowing  
Blowing like she's at my chamber door  
  
You smiling through the fence at me  
Just like you always smiled before  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more  
  
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?  
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart  
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going  
You're like a time bomb in my heart  
  
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling  
Must be the mother of our Lord  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like my woman's on board  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away  
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going  
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day  
  
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed  
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead  
  
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?  
Blowing through another no good town  
  
The lights on my native land are glowing  
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round  
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing  
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb  
  
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like she's blowing right on time

",Bob Dylan
"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so  
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.  
  
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go  
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow  
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast  
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last.  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be  
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train  
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain.

",Bob Dylan
"All the early Roman kings  
In their sharkskin suits  
Bow ties and buttons  
High top boots  
Drivin' the spikes in  
Blazin' the rails  
Nailed in their coffins  
In top hats and tails  
  
Fly away, little bird  
Fly away, flap your wings  
Fly by night  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
All the early Roman kings  
In the early, early morn  
Coming down the mountain  
Distributing the corn  
Speeding through the forest  
Racing down the track  
You try to get away  
They drag you back  
  
Tomorrow is Friday  
We'll see what it brings  
Everybody's talking  
'Bout the early Roman kings  
  
They're peddlers and they're meddlers  
They buy and they sell  
They destroyed your city  
They'll destroy you as well  
They're lecherous and treacherous  
Hell-bent for leather  
Each of 'em bigger  
Than all men put together  
  
Sluggers and muggers  
Wearing fancy gold rings  
All the women goin' crazy  
For the early Roman kings  
  
I can dress up your wounds  
With a blood-clotted rag  
I ain't afraid to make love  
To a bitch or a hag  
If you see me comin'  
And you're standing there  
Wave your handkerchief  
In the air  
  
I ain't dead yet  
My bell still rings  
I keep my fingers crossed  
Like them early Roman kings  
  
I can strip you of life  
Strip you of breath  
Ship you down  
To the house of death  
One day  
You will ask for me  
There'll be no one else  
That you'll wanna see  
  
Bring down my fiddle  
Tune up my strings  
I'm gonna break it wide open  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
I was up on black mountain  
The day Detroit fell  
They killed 'em all off  
And they sent 'em to hell  
Ding dong daddy  
You're coming up short  
Gonna put you on trial  
In a Sicilian court  
  
I've had my fun  
I've had my flings  
Gonna shake 'em all down  
Like the early Roman kings

",Bob Dylan
"Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,  
Never let it slip away.  
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray.  
When ya get half cra-zy from the August heat  
Or on a frozen, rotted road  
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're gonna walk that endless highway,  
Walk that high-way till you die.  
All you children goin' my way,  
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.  
  
When I see a detour up ahead,  
Well, I leave it far behind,  
Who knows what you're apt to find there.  
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',  
Well it look like t'me this time I wont be buyin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When they get a scapegoat by the throat,  
it's hard labour and cold beans.  
If ya get away real quick,  
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.  
Well, I sing by night, wander by day.  
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay.  
  
[Chorus]

",Bob Dylan
"I sang the song slowly  
As she stood in the shadows  
She stepped to the light  
As my silver strings spun  
She called with her eyes  
To the tune I's a-playin'  
But the song it was long  
And I'd only begun  
  
Through a bullet of light  
Her face was reflectin'  
The fast fading words  
That rolled from my tongue  
With a long-distance look  
Her eyes was on fire  
But the song it was long  
And there was more to be sung.  
  
My eyes danced a circle  
Across her clear outline  
With her head tilted sideways  
She called me again  
As the tune drifted out  
She breathed hard through the echo  
But the song it was long  
And it was far to the end  
  
I glanced at my guitar  
And played it pretendin'  
That of all the eyes out there  
I could see none  
As her thoughts pounded hard  
Like the pierce of an arrow  
But the song it was long  
And it had to get done  
  
As the tune finally folded  
I laid down the guitar  
Then looked for the girl  
Who'd stayed for so long  
But her shadow was missin'  
For all of my searchin'  
So I picked up my guitar  
And began the next song

",Bob Dylan
"The eastern world it is explodin'  
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'  
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'  
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin'  
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'  
  
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Don't you understand, what I'm trying to say?  
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?  
If the button is pushed, there's no running away  
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave  
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'  
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'  
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation  
Handful of Senators don't pass legislation  
And marches alone can't bring integration  
When human respect is disintegratin'  
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Think of all the hate there is in Red China  
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama  
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space  
But when your return, it's the same old place  
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace  
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace  
Hate your next-door-neighbor, but don't forget to say grace  
  
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

",Bob Dylan
"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need  
When the pool of tears beneath my feet floods every newborn seed  
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and the morals of despair  
  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand  
  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

",Bob Dylan
"Broken lines, broken strings,  
Broken threads, broken springs,  
Broken idols, broken heads,  
People sleeping in broken beds.  
Ain't no use jiving  
Ain't no use joking  
Everything is broken.  
  
Broken bottles, broken plates,  
Broken switches, broken gates,  
Broken dishes, broken parts,  
Streets are filled with broken hearts.  
Broken words never meant to be spoken,  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Seem like every time you stop and turn around  
Something else just hit the ground  
  
Broken cutters, broken saws,  
Broken buckles, broken laws,  
Broken bodies, broken bones,  
Broken voices on broken phones.  
Take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin',  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Every time you leave and go off someplace  
Things fall to pieces in my face  
  
Broken hands on broken ploughs,  
Broken treaties, broken vows,  
Broken pipes, broken tools,  
People bending broken rules.  
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,  
Everything is broken.

"Oh it's fare thee well my darlin' true,  
I'm leavin' in the first hour of the morn.  
I'm bound off for the bay of Mexico  
Or maybe the coast of Californ.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard  
And the rain she's a-turnin' into hail.  
I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin' west,  
Though I'm travelin' on a path beaten trail.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
I will write you a letter from time to time,  
As I'm ramblin' you can travel with me too.  
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love,  
I will send what I learn back home to you.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles,  
Be them somebody else's or my own.  
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high,  
I will travel unnoticed and unknown.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
I've heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound,  
It's down around the old Mexican plains.  
They say that the people are all friendly there  
And all they ask of you is your name.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.

"Farewell Angelina  
The bells of the crown  
Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is on fire  
And I must go.  
  
There's no need for anger  
There's no need for blame  
There's nothing to prove  
Ev'rything's still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is trembling  
And I must leave.  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
I'll see you in a while.  
  
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawed-off shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky's changing color  
And I must leave fast.  
  
King Kong, little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos  
While the make-up man's hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone.  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where it's quiet.

Father, who taketh the darkness away,  
Father, who teacheth the bird to fly,  
Builder of rainbows up in the sky,  
Father of loneliness and pain,  
Father of love and Father of rain.  
  
Father of day, Father of night,  
Father of black, Father of white,

Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky,

Father of whom we most solemnly praise.

"I hear that train a-rolling, it's a-rolling round the bend  
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

"Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man  
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male  
They sang ""Danny Boy"" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer  
Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed  
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up  
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground  
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up  
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names  
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed  
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine  
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed  
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
There's a retired businessman named Red, cast down from heaven and he's out of
his head  
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch  
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash  
He's not somebody that you play around with much  
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is  
She'll do wondrous works with your fate  
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed  
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight  
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors  
How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours  
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks  
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks  
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in  
Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
They got some beautiful people out there, man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Yes, I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill  
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on, this'll be where you're from  
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come  
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back

"May God bless and keep you always  
May your wishes all come true  
May you always do for others  
And let others do for you  
May you build a ladder to the stars  
And climb on every rung  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.  
  
May you grow up to be righteous  
May you grow up to be true  
May you always know the truth  
And see the lights surrounding you  
May you always be courageous  
Stand upright and be strong  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.  
  
May your hands always be busy  
May your feet always be swift  
May you have a strong foundation  
When the winds of changes shift  
May your heart always be joyful  
And may your song always be sung  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.

"Forgetful heart  
Lost your power of recall  
Every little detail  
You don't remember at all  
The times we knew  
Who would remember better than you?  
  
Forgetful heart  
We laughed and had a good time, you and I  
It's been so long  
Now you're content to let the days go by  
When you were there  
You were the answer to my prayer  
  
Forgetful heart  
We loved with all the love that life can give  
What can I say?  
Without you it's so hard to live  
Can't take much more  
Why can't we love like we did before?  
  
Forgetful heart  
Like a walking shadow in my brain  
All night long  
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain  
The door has closed forevermore  
If indeed there ever was a door

"I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids  
But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid  
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me the bread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge  
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge  
And then she comes down the thruway, ready to sew me up with a thread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much  
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch  
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead  
I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head  
She brings me everything and more, and just like I said  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed

"Full moon and empty arms  
The moon is there for us to share  
But where are you?  
  
A night like this  
Could weave a memory  
And every kiss  
Could start a dream for two  
  
Full moon and empty arms  
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon  
And next full moon  
If my one wish comes true  
My empty arms will be filled with you

Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon

"Of war and peace the truth just twists  
Its curfew gull just glides  
Upon four-legged forest clouds  
The cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun  
Though its glow is waxed in black  
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden  
  
The lamppost stands with folded arms  
Its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Though it shadows metal badge  
All and all can only fall  
With a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
  
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand  
And then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf  
But still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay  
At ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
  
With a time-rusted compass blade  
Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks  
Side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise  
You will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
  
Relationships of ownership  
They whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly  
And wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs  
The lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The motorcycle black Madonna  
Two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause  
The gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey  
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The kingdoms of experience  
In the precious wind they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince  
Discuss what's real and what is not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The foreign sun, it squints upon  
A bed that is never mine  
As friends and other strangers  
From their fates try to resign  
Leaving men wholly, totally free  
To do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
  
At dawn my lover comes to me  
And tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words  
But these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

"I woke up this mornin',  
There were tears in my bed.  
They killed a man I really loved  
Shot him through the head.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Sent him off to prison  
For a seventy-dollar robbery.  
Closed the door behind him  
And they threw away the key.  
Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
He wouldn't take shit from no one  
He wouldn't bow down or kneel.  
Authorities, they hated him  
Because he was just too real.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Prison guards, they cursed him  
As they watched him from above  
But they were frightened of his power  
They were scared of his love.  
Lord, Lord,  
So they cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.  
  
Sometimes I think this whole world  
Is one big prison yard.  
Some of us are prisoners  
The rest of us are guards.  
Lord, Lord,  
They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.

I just go pump on it some.

And just set there waitin' for me to come.

"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears  
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.  
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.  
There are frail forms fainting at the door.  
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
There's pale drooping maiden who foils her life away  
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er.  
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day,  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.

"Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song.  
Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.  
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell  
'Bout an east coast city that you all know well.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Old new york city is a friendly old town,  
From Washington heights to Harlem on down.  
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,  
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate  
To Rockefeller plaza n' the Empire State.  
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,  
Old mister empire never says a word.  
  
It's hard times from the country,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.  
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.  
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,  
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten island ferry.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream  
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.  
Bought your city on a one-way track,  
If I had my way I'd sell it right back.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
I'll take all the smog in California  
'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,  
'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.  
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
So all you newsy people, spreadin' the news around,  
You see'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.  
You see'n step on my name, you see'n try 'n' get me beat,  
When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.  
  
Hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.

God and sinners reconciled!""  
Joyful, all ye nations rise,  
Join the triumph of the skies,  
With angelic host proclaim  
""Christ is born in Bethlehem!""  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
""Glory to the newborn King!""

"Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends  
Who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
  
Someday soon  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Until then we'll  
Have to motor through somehow  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now  
  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Once again  
As in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends  
Who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
  
Someday soon  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
So hang a shining star  
Upon the highest bough  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now

"Hazel, dirty-blonde hair  
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.  
You got something I want plenty of  
Ooh, a little touch of your love.  
  
Hazel, stardust in your eye  
You're goin' somewhere and so am I.  
I'd give you the sky high above  
Ooh, for a little touch of your love.  
  
Oh no, I don't need any reminder  
To know how much I really care  
But it's just making me blinder and blinder  
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.  
  
Hazel, you called and I came,  
Now don't make me play this waiting game.  
You've got something I want plenty of  
Ooh, a little touch of your love.

"He was a friend of mine  
He was a friend of mine  
Every time I think about him now  
Lord I just can't keep from cryin'  
'Cause he was a friend of mine  
  
He died on the road  
He died on the road  
He never had enough money  
To pay his room or board  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
I stole away and cried  
I stole away and cried  
'Cause I never had too much money  
And I never been quite satisfied  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
He never done no wrong  
He never done no wrong  
A thousand miles from home  
And he never harmed no one  
And he was a friend of mine

"Heart of mine be still  
You can play with fire but you'll get the bill  
Don't let her know  
Don't let her know that you love her  
Don't be a fool, don't be blind  
Heart of mine.  
  
Heart of mine go back home  
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam  
Don't let her see  
Don't let her see that you need her  
Don't put yourself over the line  
Heart of mine.  
  
Heart of mine go back where you have been  
It'll only be trouble for you if you let her in  
Don't let her hear  
Don't let her hear you want her  
Don't let her hear know she's so fine  
Heart of mine.  
  
Heart of mine you know that she'll never be true  
She'll only give to others the love that she's gotten from you  
Don't let her know  
Don't let her know where you're going  
Don't untie the ties that bind  
Heart of mine.  
  
Hear of mine so malicious and so full of guile  
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile  
Don't let yourself fall  
Don't let yourself stumble  
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime

I swear she's the screaming end  
She wants me to be a hero  
So she can tell all her friends  
  
Well, she begged, she cried  
She pleaded with me all last night  
Well, she begged, she cried  
She pleaded with me all last night  
She wants me to go out  
And find somebody to fight  
  
She reads too many books  
She got new movies inside her head

One that can grab and hold your heart  
Need a different kind of man, babe

Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand  
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.

Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51.

"Oh, God said to Abraham, ""Kill me a son""  
Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on""  
God said, ""No"" Abe say, ""What?""  
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but  
The next time you see me comin', you better run""  
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose  
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes  
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""  
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King  
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings  
And a thousand telephones that don't ring  
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""  
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""  
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done  
Just take everything down to Highway 61""  
  
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night  
Told the first father that things weren't right  
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""  
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""  
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""  
But the second mother was with the seventh son  
And they were both out on Highway 61  
  
Now, the roving gambler he was very bored  
Trying to create a next world war  
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor  
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before  
But yes, I think it can be very easily done  
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun  
And have it on Highway 61""

"Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps  
Some of these women they just give me the creeps

These memories I got, they can strangle a man  
  
Well I came ashore in the dead of the night  
Lot of things can get in the way when you're tryin' to do what's right  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm not sorry for nothin' I've done  
I'm glad I fought - I only wish we'd won  
The Siamese twins are comin' to town  
People can't wait - they're gathered around  
  
When I left my home the sky split open wide  
I never wanted to go back there - I'd rather have died  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
You'd be honest with me if only you knew

She's tossin' a baseball bat in the air  
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword

You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice  
Well, I'll sell it to ya at a reduced price  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you

I won't come here no more if it bothers you

I'm having a hard time believin' some people were ever alive

I'm going off into the woods, I'm huntin' bare  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm here to create the new imperial empire  
I'm going to do whatever circumstances require  
I care so much for you - didn't think that I could  
I can't tell my heart that you're no good

"There is a house down in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl  
And me, oh God, I'm one.  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these new blue jeans  
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk.  
  
He fills his glasses up to the brim  
And he'll pass the cards around  
And the only pleasure he gets out of life  
Is rambling from town to town.  
  
Oh tell my baby sister  
Not to do what I have done  
But shun that house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun.  
  
Well it's one foot on the platform  
And the other foot on the train  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
To wear that ball and chain.  
  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
My race is almost run  
I'm going back to end my life  
Down in the rising sun.

"Well I wandered alone,  
Through a desert of stone,  
And I dreamed of my future wife.  
My sword's in my hand,  
And I'm next in command,  
In this version of Death called Life.  
My plate and my cup,  
Are right straight up,  
I took a rose from the hand of a child.  
When I kiss your lips,  
The honey drips,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Every day we meet,  
On any old street,  
And you're in your girlish prime.  
The short and the tall,  
Are coming to the ball,  
I go there all the time.  
Behind every tree,  
There's something to see,  
The river is wider than a mile.  
I tried you twice,  
You can't be nice,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Here come the nurse,  
With money in her purse,  
Here come the ladies and men.  
You push it all in,  
And you've no chance to win,  
You play 'em on down to the end.  
I'm laying in the sand,  
Getting a sunshine tan,  
Moving along, riding in style.  
From my toes to my head,  
You knock me dead,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
I count the years,  
And I shed no tears,  
I'm blinded to what might have been.  
Nature's voice,  
Makes my heart rejoice,  
Play me the wild song of the wind.  
I found hopeless love,  
In the room above,  
When the sun and the weather were riled.  
You're as fine as wine,  
I ain't handing you no line,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
All the merry little elves,  
Can go hang themselves,  
My faith is as cold as can be.  
I'm stacked high to the roof,  
And I'm not without proof,  
If you don't believe me, come see.  
You think I'm blue,  
I think so, too,  
In my words you'll find no guile.  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.

"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed  
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Think I'll go out and go for a walk  
Not much happening here, nothing ever does  
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk  
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man see my face and lives.  
  
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race  
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight  
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck  
The world could come to an end tonight, bt that's all right  
She could still be there sleeping when I get back.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.

In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives

One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

"They ask me how I feel  
And if my love is real  
And how I know I'll make it through  
And they, they look at me and frown  
They'd like to drive me from this town  
They don't want me around  
'Cause I believe in you.  
  
They show me to the door  
They say don't come back no more  
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to  
And I, I walk out on my own  
A thousand miles from home  
But I don't feel alone  
'Cause I believe in you.  
  
I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter  
I believe in you even though we be apart  
I believe in you even on the morning after  
Oh, when the dawn is nearing  
Oh, when the night is disappearing  
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart.  
  
Don't let me drift too far  
Keep me where you are  
Where I will always be renewed  
And that which you've given me today  
Is worth more than I could pay  
And no matter what they say  
I believe in you.  
  
I believe in you when winter turn to summer  
I believe in you when white turn to black  
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered  
Oh, though the earth may shake me  
Oh, though my friends forsake me  
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.  
  
Don't let me change my heart  
Keep me set apart  
From all the plans they do pursue  
And I, I don't mind the pain  
Don't mind the driving rain  
I know I will sustain  
'Cause I believe in you.

"I can't understand, she let go of my hand  
An' left me here facing the wall  
I'd sure like to know, why she did go  
But I can't get close to her at all  
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime  
She said she would never forget  
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here  
She acts like we never met  
It's all new to me like some mystery  
It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one  
That last night I was with  
From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling  
I remember her whispering yet  
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't  
She just acts like we never have met  
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way  
Of this I can't say very much  
But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched  
An' if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?""  
I'll say, ""It's easily done  
You just pick anyone  
An' pretend that you never have met""

"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive as you or me  
Tearing through these quarters  
In the utmost misery  
With a blanket underneath his arm  
And a coat of solid gold  
Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".  
  
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive with fiery breath  
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones  
That put him out to death  
Oh, I awoke in anger  
So alone and terrified  
I put my fingers against the glass  
And bowed my head and cried.

You think you'll find  
A heaven of bliss  
In each caress  
In each tender kiss  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You didn't care how it hurt me  
But you can never steal away

You think she's yours  
To have and to hold  
Someday you'll learn  
When her love grows cold  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

"I pity the poor immigrant  
Who wishes he would've stayed home,  
Who uses all his power to do evil  
But in the end is always left so alone.  
That man whom with his fingers cheats  
And who lies with ev'ry breath,  
Who passionately hates his life  
And likewise, fears his death.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Whose strength is spent in vain,  
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,  
Whose tears are like rain,  
Who eats but is not satisfied,  
Who hears but does not see,  
Who falls in love with wealth itself  
And turns his back on me.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Who tramples through the mud,  
Who fills his mouth with laughing  
And who builds his town with blood,  
Whose visions in the final end  
Must shatter like the glass.

When his gladness comes to pass.

"Well, I took me a woman late last night,  
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.  
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,  
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""  
I hot-footed it, bare-naked  
Out the window!  
  
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.

And I had to get out quick

She's a humdinger  
Folk singer  
Dead ringer  
For a thing-a-muh jigger  
  
Late one day in the middle of the week,  
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.  
I chased me a woman up the hill,  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.  
It was Little Bo Peep!  
(I jumped a fallout shelter  
I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel)  
  
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,  
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.  
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,  
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.  
(He's eatin' bagels  
He's eatin' pizza  
He's eatin' chitlins  
He's eatin' bullshit!)  
  
Oh, set me down on a television floor,  
I'll flip the channel to number four.  
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.  
(It's that greasy kid stuff.  
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)  
  
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.  
She takes about fifteen baths a day,  
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.  
(She's a little bit heavy!)  
  
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,  
It levels my head and eases my mind.  
I just walk along and stroll and sing,  
I see better days and I do better things.  
I catch dinosaurs  
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor  
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)

"I'm just average, common too  
I'm just like him, the same as you  
I'm everybody's brother and son  
I ain't different from anyone  
It ain't no use a-talking to me  
It's just the same as talking to you.  
  
I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day  
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay  
I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come  
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine  
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run  
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you  
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen.""  
  
Well, I don't know, but I've been told  
The streets in heaven are lined with gold  
I ask you how things could get much worse  
If the Russians happen to get up there first.  
Wowee! Pretty scary!  
  
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree  
I want ev'rybody to be free  
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater  
Move in next door and marry my daughter  
You must think I'm crazy!  
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.  
  
Well, I set my monkey on the log  
And ordered him to do the Dog  
He wagged his tail and shook his head  
And he went and did the Cat instead  
He's a weird monkey, very funky.  
  
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on  
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun  
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist  
And my wig-hat was falling in my face  
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.  
  
I gotta woman, she's so mean  
She sticks my boots in the washing machine  
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude  
Puts bubblegum in my food  
She's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey.""  
  
Now I gotta friend who spends his life  
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife  
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf  
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.  
I've got a million friends!  
  
Now they asked me to read a poem  
At the sorority sister's home  
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'  
I wound up with the Dean of Women  
Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.  
Hope I don't blow it.  
  
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange  
So I look like a walking mountain range  
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  
Out to the country club and the golf course.  
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.  
  
Now you're probably wondering by now  
Just what this song is all about  
What's probably got you baffled more  
Is what this thing here is for.  
It's nothing  
It's something I learned over in England.

",Bob Dylan
"They say evrything can be replaced,  
Yet every distance is not near.  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
They say every man needs protection,  
They say every man must fall.  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place so high above this wall.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.  
All day long I hear him shout so loud,  
Crying out that he was framed.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.

",Bob Dylan
"I once held her in my arms,  
She said she would always stay.  
But I was cruel,  
I treated her like a fool,  
I threw it all away.  
  
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,  
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.  
I must have been mad,  
I never knew what I had,  
Until I threw it all away.  
  
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,  
Love and only love, it can't be denied.  
No matter what you think about it  
You just won't be able to do without it.  
Take a tip from one who's tried.  
  
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,  
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,  
For one thing that's certain,  
You will surely be a-hurtin',  
If you throw it all away.

"Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand  
And the judge says, ""Mona can't have no bond.""

And the rain man leaves in the wolf man's disguise.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit  
Says to the masked man, ""ain't you cute!""  
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf  
And he says, ""you ain't so bad yourself.""

I want to be your lover, baby,

Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,  
Stretchin' out upon the grass.  
She gets all messed up and she faints  
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.

I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.

"The guilty undertaker sighs,  
The lonely organ grinder cries,  
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.  
The cracked bells and washed-out horns  
Blow into my face with scorn,  
But it's not that way,  
I wasn't born to lose you.  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.  
  
The drunken politician leaps  
Upon the street where mothers weep  
And the saviors who are fast asleep,  
They wait for you.  
And I wait for them to interrupt  
Me drinkin' from my broken cup  
And ask me to  
Open up the gate for you.  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.  
  
Now all my fathers, they've gone down,  
True love they've been without it.  
But all their daughters put me down  
Cause I don't think about it.  
  
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades  
And talk with my chambermaid.  
She knows that I'm not afraid  
To look at her.  
She is good to me  
And there's nothing she doesn't see.  
She knows where I'd like to be  
But it doesn't matter.  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.  
  
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit,  
He spoke to me, I took his flute.  
No, I wasn't very cute to him,  
Was I?  
But I did it, though, because he lied  
Because he took you for a ride  
And because time was on his side  
And because I  
I want you, I want you,  
I want you so bad,  
Honey, I want you.

To my home, Lord, to my home,

It was just the other day  
I was drinkin' on my pay  
When I met an old friend I used to know.  
He said your mother's dead and gone,  
Your baby sister's all gone wrong,  
And your daddy needs you home right away.  
  
Not a shirt on my back,

Maw would come and whip me back,  
On them tressles down by ol' Jim McKay's.  
  
When I pay the debt I owe  
To the commissary store,  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.  
Oh home, Lord Lord Lord,  
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home.

When I see them ridin' blinds,  
Gonna make me a home out in the wind.  
In the wind, Lord, in the wind,  
Make me a home out in the wind.  
  
I don't like it in the wind,  
I want to go back home again,  
But I can't go home this a'way.

"Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press  
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.  
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.  
I can't help it if I'm lucky.  
  
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act  
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.  
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,  
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that  
Sweet lady.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,  
Blowing down the back roads headin' south.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike  
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.  
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,  
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won
the wars  
After losin' every battle.  
  
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are  
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars.  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.  
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,  
Blood on your saddle.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,  
Blowing through the curtains in your room.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.  
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped,  
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top  
You're on the bottom.  
  
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes  
Don't look into mine.  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building  
Burned.  
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read  
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.  
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,  
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin' glory.  
  
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me.  
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,  
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,  
And it makes me feel so sorry.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.  
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,  
We're idiots, babe.  
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.

"If dogs run free, then why not we  
Across the swooping plain?  
My ears hear a symphony  
Of two mules, trains and rain.  
The best is always yet to come,  
That's what they explain to me.  
Just do your thing, you'll be king,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, why not me  
Across the swamp of time?  
My mind weaves a symphony  
And tapestry of rhyme.  
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee  
So it may flow and be,  
To each his own, it's all unknown,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, then what must be,  
Must be, and that is all.  
True love can make a blade of grass  
Stand up straight and tall.  
In harmony with the cosmic sea,  
True love needs no company,  
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,  
If dogs run free.

Babe, I'd lay awake all night,  
Wait for the mornin' light  
To shine in through,  
But it would not be new,  
If not for you.  
  
If not for you

"If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier  
She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear  
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow  
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.  
  
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will  
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill  
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart  
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.  
  
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me  
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free  
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way  
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
stay.  
  
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds  
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off  
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.  
  
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past  
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast  
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find  
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

When I'm all alone  
In the great unknown  
I'll remember you.  
  
I'll remember you

I had so much left to do  
I had so little time to fail  
There's some people that  
You don't forget

One time or two  
When the roses fade  
And I'm in the shade  
I'll remember you.

Didn't I, didn't I try to care?  
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you  
With the rain blowing in your hair.  
  
I'll remember you  
When the wind blows through the piny wood  
It was you who came right through  
It was you who understood  
Though I'd never say  
That I done it the way  
That you'd have liked me to  
In the end  
My dear sweet friend  
I'll remember you.

"She came all rightoned and she's all too tight in my neighborhood  
She cried both day and night  
I know it because it was there.  
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck  
And she daily salooning, but to me too hot to book  
I would then.  
  
I believe where she'd stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where she's on my way, but I don't belong there.  
No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry  
She's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on  
When I'm there she's alright, but when she's not when I'm gone.  
Heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one  
She's the way for sailing beautiful  
She's mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she don't bother me  
But I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Now I've cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And I'm leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
It's so long she's forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It don't hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well.  
  
Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And it's not too fast or slam  
But I'll not perceive her  
I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell  
And it's all affirmation I received but it's not  
She's a long haunting beauty  
But she's gone like the spark  
And she's gone.  
  
Yes she's gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now she's home beside me  
And I'd like to hear to stay  
She's a bone forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's too hard to stake in  
And I don't far believe  
It's a bag full it's amusing  
That she's hard too hard to lead.  
It's a load, it's a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me, but just don't forethink in clown.  
  
Yes I believe that it's rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind  
I been told like I said one night before  
Carry on the grind.  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But I'm not there I'm gone.

"Well, in my time of dying don't want nobody to mourn  
All I want for you to do is take my body home  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Well, well, well  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up  
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.  
  
Well, meet me Jesus, meet me, meet me in the middle of the air  
If these wings should fail me  
Lord, won't you meet me with another pair?  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Well, well, well  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up  
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.  
  
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry  
All I want you to do is take me when I die  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Well, well, well  
Well, well, well, so I can die easy  
Jesus gonna make up, Jesus gonna make up  
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.

"When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?  
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?  
Did they know He was the Son of God, did they know that He was Lord?  
Did they hear when He told Peter, ""Peter, put up your sword""?  
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?  
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?  
  
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?  
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?  
Nicodemus came at night so he wouldn't be seen by men  
Saying, ""Master, tell me why a man must be born again.""  
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?  
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?  
  
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?  
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?  
When He said, ""Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize?  
Same thing My Father do, I can do likewise.""  
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?  
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?  
  
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?  
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?  
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head  
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?  
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?  
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?  
  
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?  
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?  
He said, ""All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth.""  
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?  
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?  
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?  
  
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?  
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?  
He said, ""All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth.""  
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?  
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?

"Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?  
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?  
I've been burned before and I know the score  
So you won't hear me complain.  
Will I be able to count on you  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?  
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?  
Do you know my world, do you know my kind  
Or must I explain?  
Will you let me be myself  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,  
I've been in and out of happiness.  
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings  
And I've never been too impressed.  
  
All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you  
If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too.  
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,  
Do you understand my pain?  
Are you willing to risk it all  
Or is your love in vain?

"I married Isis on the fifth day of May  
But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""  
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""  
I said ""That's the best new that I've ever heard"".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize""  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special ?""  
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""  
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""  
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".  
  
Isis oh Isis you mystical child  
What drives me to you is what drives me insane  
I still can remember the way that you smiled  
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.

"Go 'way from my window  
Leave at your own chosen speed  
I'm not the one you want, babe  
I'm not the one you need  
You say you're lookin' for someone  
Who's never weak but always strong  
To protect you an' defend you  
Whether you are right or wrong  
Someone to open each and every door  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me babe  
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.  
  
Go lightly from the ledge, babe  
Go lightly on the ground  
I'm not the one you want, babe  
I will only let your down  
You say you're lookin' for someone  
Who will promise never to part  
Someone to close his eyes for you  
Someone to close his heart  
Someone who will die for you an' more  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me babe  
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.  
  
Go melt back into the night  
Everything inside is made of stone  
There's nothing in here moving  
An' anyway I'm not alone  
You say you're looking for someone  
Who'll pick you up each time you fall  
To gather flowers constantly  
An' to come each time you call  
A lover for you life an' nothing more  
But it ain't me, babe  
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe  
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

"So run here baby, put your little hands in mine  
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
I want you baby just to understand  
I don't want to be your boss babe, I just want to be your man  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
Now when you go home, you don't have to get along  
Come back to me babe, where I live that's where you belong  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
I love you baby an' you know that it's true  
I wouldn't mistreat you baby, nothin' in this world is like you  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
Yes when things go wrong, so wrong with you  
It hurts me too  
  
So run here baby, put your little hand in mine  
I got something to tell you baby, I know that will change your mind  
When things go wrong, so wrong with you  
Don't you know it, don't you know it hurts me too

"You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last  
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun  
Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are comin' through  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense  
Take what you have gathered from coincidence  
The empty-handed painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky, too, is folding under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home  
All your reindeer armies, are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet, too, is moving under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you  
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you  
The vagabond who's rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match, go start anew  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

",Bob Dylan
